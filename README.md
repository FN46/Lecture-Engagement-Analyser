# Lecture-Engagement-Analyser
Lecture Engagement Analyser is a capstone project that uses speech analysis techniques to assess student engagement levels during university lectures. By evaluating vocal patterns and acoustic features in recorded or real-time speech, the tool provides insight into the lecturers ability to engage using their voice.
